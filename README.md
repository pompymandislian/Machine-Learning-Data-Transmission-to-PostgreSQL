In this project, we focus on saving prediction data to a PostgreSQL database. Our emphasis is not on modeling intricacies but rather on utilizing dummy data and simple predictions. Leveraging FastAPI and Streamlit, we establish connectivity to the database, 
resulting in a seamless integration. Check out the demo below to witness the functionality in action. Thank you for your interest, and enjoy exploring!
